# Freebird

## A starter theme for Statamic with a Laravel Mix build system and Tailwind CSS

### How To

To use the build system, run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev` -- the usual mix commands will work!
Feel free to take out the `home.html` template and build your theme as you see fit!

### Configuration

By default, Freebird configures `primary-*` classes for Tailwind and sets them to purple.
This can be easily changed in the `tailwind.config.js` file

### Contributing

This project is new, pull requests, ideas, and any feedback is certainly welcome!
